    ### Step 4: AI Build

    <Card title="4. AI Build" icon="robot">
        Create your HTML webpage using an AI agent. We've shown the default Cursor AI in this example,
        but you can use any AI agent you prefer, such as Claude Code, GPT Code, Gemini CLI, or any other AI coding assistant.

        **Key Requirements:**

        - Instruct your AI agent to follow the HTFlow rules that were established during the project initialization step
        - Provide the `.cursor` folder, `htflowrc.json`, and `AI_prompt.md` files as context to your AI agent (Cursor AI or others)
        - This ensures the AI agent will generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is compatible with Webflow and Droip conversion requirements

        **Best Practices:**

        - Start with a clear description of your website requirements
        - Ask the AI to follow the HTFlow rules from the configuration files
        - Iterate on the design until you're satisfied with the result
        - Save your files before proceeding to the audit step


         **Example AI Prompts for HTFlow Development**

    ### Step 5: Audit and Validation

    <Card title="5. Audit and Validation" icon="shield-check">
        Once you're satisfied with your AI-generated design, run the audit to validate your code against HTFlow rules.

        In the HTFlow panel, click on the **"Validation"** tab and then click the **"Audit Project"** button.
        HTFlow will execute the `npx htflow audit` command in the terminal.

        **What the Audit Does:**

        - Scans your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for rule violations
        - Displays all compatibility issues that need to be fixed
        - Provides detailed error messages and suggestions

        **Fixing Errors:**

        If you encounter any errors, simply copy the entire terminal output and paste it into your AI agent's chat box,
        asking the AI to fix the issues. The AI will resolve all the errors for you.
        You can run the audit repeatedly until you achieve zero errors.

            alt="HTFlow Dev Server"
          />
        </Frame>

        <Info>
          The HTFlow development server is strongly recommended for development mode, as the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/htflow-html-to-webflow-cu/nnkbaccknjdofhmijbddaohboaenbpci" target="_blank">HTFlow Chrome extension</a> only functions properly with this server type. This ensures full compatibility and access to all development features.
        </Info>
    </Card>

    ### Step 7: Production Server

    <Card title="7. Production Server" icon="rocket">
        In the HTFlow panel, click the **"Server"** tab where you'll see two server options:

        - **HTFlow Serve Dev (Development Server)**: For testing and development
        - **HTFlow Serve Start (Production Server)**: For final deployment and production use

        **When to Use the Production Server:**

        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/image__htflow-start-server.png"
            alt="HTFlow production server"
          />
        </Frame>

        <Info>
          The production server intentionally disables JavaScript to preserve the original HTML structure.
          This ensures compatibility with the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/htflow-html-to-webflow-cu/nnkbaccknjdofhmijbddaohboaenbpci" target="_blank">HTFlow Chrome Extension</a>
          for Webflow and Droip conversion. Please note that in production mode, JavaScript functionality will not work - this is specifically designed for conversion purposes.
        </Info>
    </Card>

    ### Step 8: Build for Conversion

    <Card title="8. Build for Conversion" icon="hammer">
        In the HTFlow panel, click the **"Build"** tab and then click the **"Build Project"** button.

        This will create a folder in your project root called **htflow-copyable** and organize each HTML file
        as a separate folder containing the copyable HTML, CSS, and JS codes. These files can be used to convert
        into Webflow or Droip using the HTFlow Webflow app or HTFlow web app:

        - <a href="https://htflow.com/html-to-webflow" target="_blank">HTML to Webflow</a>
        - <a href="https://htflow.com/html-to-droip" target="_blank">HTML to Droip</a>

        **Example folder structure after build:**

        ```text
        htflow-copyable/
        ├── index/
        │   ├── index.html
        │   ├── index.css
        │   └── index.js
        └── about/
            ├── about.html
            ├── about.css
            └── about.js
        ```

        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/image_cursor-build.png"
            alt="HTFlow cursor build"
