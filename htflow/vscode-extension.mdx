    </Card>

    <Card title="4. AI Build" icon="robot">
        Create your HTML webpage using an AI agent. We've shown the default Copilot Agent for VS Code in this example,
        but you can use any AI agent you prefer, such as Cursor, Claude Code, GPT Code, Gemini CLI, or any other AI coding assistant.

        **Key Requirements:**

        - Instruct your AI agent to follow the HTFlow rules that were established during the project initialization step
        - Provide the `.cursor` folder, `htflowrc.json`, and `AI_prompt.md` files as context to your AI agent (Copilot or others)
        - This ensures the AI agent will generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is compatible with Webflow and Droip conversion requirements

        **Best Practices:**

        - Start with a clear description of your website requirements
        - Ask the AI to follow the HTFlow rules from the configuration files
        - Iterate on the design until you're satisfied with the result
        - Save your files before proceeding to the audit step
    </Card>

    <Card title="5. Audit and Validation" icon="shield-check">
        Once you're satisfied with your AI-generated design, run the audit to validate your code against HTFlow rules.

        In the HTFlow panel, click on the **"Validation"** tab and then click the **"Audit Project"** button.
        HTFlow will execute the `npx htflow audit` command in the terminal.

        **What the Audit Does:**

        - Scans your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for rule violations
        - Displays all compatibility issues that need to be fixed
        - Provides detailed error messages and suggestions

        **Fixing Errors:**

        If you encounter any errors, simply copy the entire terminal output and paste it into your AI agent's chat box,
        asking the AI to fix the issues. The AI will resolve all the errors for you.
        You can run the audit repeatedly until you achieve zero errors.

    <Card title="6. Development Server" icon="server">
        In the HTFlow panel, click the **"Server"** tab where you'll see two server options:

        - **HTFlow Serve Dev (Development Server)**: For testing and development
        - **HTFlow Serve Start (Production Server)**: For final deployment and production use

        **Why Use a Development Server?**

        The development server is essential for several reasons:

        1. **Live Preview**: You can see your website changes in real-time as you develop
        2. **Hot Reloading**: Automatic browser refresh when you save files
        3. **HTFlow Chrome Extension Integration**: Enables website inspection capabilities

        **How It Works:**

        When you click the **"Start Dev Server"** button, HTFlow launches a local development server that:

        - Serves your website on a local port (typically http://localhost:3050)
        - Enables real-time file watching and automatic reloading
        - Provides development-specific features and debugging tools
        - Integrates with the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/htflow-html-to-webflow-cu/nnkbaccknjdofhmijbddaohboaenbpci" target="_blank">HTFlow Chrome extension</a> for enhanced inspection

        **Chrome Extension Benefits:**

        With the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/htflow-html-to-webflow-cu/nnkbaccknjdofhmijbddaohboaenbpci" target="_blank">HTFlow Chrome extension</a> installed, development mode provides:

        - **Website Inspection**: Analyze your HTML structure and styling
        - **AI-Prompt Generation**: Generate prompts for AI agents to improve your design
        - **Design Analysis**: Get suggestions for layout and styling improvements
        - **Code Optimization**: Identify areas for better performance and compatibility

          />
        </Frame>

        <Info>
          The HTFlow development server is strongly recommended for development mode, as the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/htflow-html-to-webflow-cu/nnkbaccknjdofhmijbddaohboaenbpci" target="_blank">HTFlow Chrome extension</a> only functions properly with this server type. This ensures full compatibility and access to all development features.

    <Card title="7. Production Server" icon="rocket">
        In the HTFlow panel, click the **"Server"** tab where you'll see two server options:

        - **HTFlow Serve Dev (Development Server)**: For testing and development
        - **HTFlow Serve Start (Production Server)**: For final deployment and production use

        **When to Use the Production Server:**

        The production server is essential for several reasons:

        1. **Final Testing**: Test your website in production-like conditions
        2. **Performance Optimization**: See how your site performs with optimized settings
        3. **Deployment Preparation**: Ensure your site is ready for live deployment
        4. **Conversion Ready**: Prepare for Webflow or Droip conversion processes

        **How It Works:**

        When you click the **"Start Production Server"** button, HTFlow launches a production server that:

        - Serves your website with production-optimized settings
        - Enables minification and compression for better performance
        - Provides production-specific configurations
        - Prepares your site for deployment and conversion

        **Production Server Benefits:**

        With the production server running, you get:

        - **Optimized Performance**: Faster loading times and better resource management
        - **Conversion Compatibility**: Ensures compatibility with Webflow and Droip conversion tools
        - **Deployment Ready**: Your site is prepared for live deployment
        - **Production Testing**: Test your site as it will appear to end users

          />
        </Frame>

        <Info>
          The production server intentionally disables JavaScript to preserve the original HTML structure.
          This ensures compatibility with the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/htflow-html-to-webflow-cu/nnkbaccknjdofhmijbddaohboaenbpci" target="_blank">HTFlow Chrome Extension</a>
          for Webflow and Droip conversion. Please note that in production mode, JavaScript functionality will not work - this is specifically designed for conversion purposes.

    <Card title="8. Build for Conversion" icon="hammer">
        In the HTFlow panel, click the **"Build"** tab and then click the **"Build Project"** button.

        This will create a folder in your project root called **htflow-copyable** and organize each HTML file
        as a separate folder containing the copyable HTML, CSS, and JS codes. These files can be used to convert
        into Webflow or Droip using the HTFlow Webflow app or HTFlow web app:

        - <a href="https://htflow.com/html-to-webflow" target="_blank">HTML to Webflow</a>
        - <a href="https://htflow.com/html-to-droip" target="_blank">HTML to Droip</a>

        **Example folder structure after build:**

        ```text
        htflow-copyable/
        ├── index/
        │   ├── index.html
        │   ├── index.css
        │   └── index.js
        └── about/
            ├── about.html
            ├── about.css
